## 📦 Install

```bash
npm install wix-style-react
```

```bash
yarn add wix-style-react
```

## 🔨 Setup

If 🐉yoshi build runner is used for your application then all required loaders are already defined. If you'd rather set up your project manually, take a look at our [webpack guide](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/docs/usage-without-yoshi.md).

Minimal Yoshi version to be used with wix-style-react:

`Version 4 - ^4.1.0`

`Version 3 - ^3.31.2`

Load Wix fonts from CDN:
  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//static.parastorage.com/services/third-party/fonts/Helvetica/fontFace.css"
  />
  ```
Enable font smoothing with browser specific css properties:
  ```css
  html {
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  }
  ```

Make sure that react and react-dom versions are not higher then:
  ```html
    //package.json
   .
   .
   "react":"16.8.3",
   "react-dom":"16.8.3"
   .
   .
   
  ```

**wix-style-react v6.x migration note**:

If you're using wix-style-react 6.x and want to shift to 7.x version then read our [migration guide](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/docs/migration/v6-v7.md).

Previous version documentation: https://wix-wix-style-react-v6.surge.sh/
  
## 🚀 Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from 'wix-style-react';

const App = () => (
  <Button>
    Click me!
  </Button>
);
```

## 💫 Testkits

All our components are provided with testkits that help our users test them.  

A component testkit provides an interface to the component, enabling automated tests to access component functions without needing to know precise details of the technology being used.

```jsx
//  Here is an example

// 1. import
import { inputTestkitFactory } from 'wix-style-react/dist/testkit';

// 2. initialize
const inputDriver = inputTestkitFactory({
  wrapper: document.body,
  dataHook: 'name-input',
});

// 3. interact
await inputDriver.enterText('hello world');
```
All methods are documented in our storybook components stories and some can be viewed through typescript interface.

Our testkits currently support four major testing frameworks: `react-jsdom`, `protractor`, `puppeteer` and `selenium`. Read our [testing guidelines](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/docs/usage/testing.md)

## ⌨️ Typescript

The library is javascript based but types are supported with `d.ts` files. Not all components have types defined, but it is ongoing process to make it so. 

Additional type interfaces are added in a separate repo called: `wsr-types` in order not to break our existing users. Read more on the repo description: https://github.com/wix/wix-ui/tree/master/packages/wsr-types
